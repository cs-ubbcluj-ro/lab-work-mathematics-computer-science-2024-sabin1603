This document specifies the format for the input file (FA.in) that defines a finite automaton.

### EBNF Definition:
finite_automaton = 
    "States:" states_list "\n"
    "Alphabet:" alphabet_list "\n"
    "Initial state:" initial_state "\n"
    "Final states:" final_states_list "\n"
    "Transitions:" transitions_list "\n" ;

states_list = state { "," state } ;
state = letter { letter | digit } ;

alphabet_list = symbol { "," symbol } ;
symbol = letter ;

transitions_list = state " " symbol " " state { "\n" state " " symbol " " state } ;

final_states_list = state { "," state } ;

initial_state = state ;



### Explanation of Components:
1. *states*: A list of all states in the automaton.
2. *alphabet*: A list of all symbols in the automaton's alphabet.
3. *transitions*: A list of transition rules. Each rule is represented as (current_state, input_symbol, next_state).
4. *final_states*: A list of all final or accepting states.
5. *initial_states*:A list of all initial states.
